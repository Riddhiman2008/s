                </h5>
                <p>Today we had our School Debate contest and I was shortlisted in the A team. The topic given was ‘Environment pollution’ and I was really excited as it is a topic close to my heart. The judges were from ABC Technical College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict to me.<br>

Our team started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to the debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the B team fought well, it was the A team which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>
